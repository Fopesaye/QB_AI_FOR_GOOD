How AI and data can help detect methane emissions 


Our immediate challenge is to detect and localize methane leaks in the atmosphere.

We have a dataset of 64x64 grayscale satellite images from different locations.

The task is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify whether a given location has a methane plume (leak) or not.
